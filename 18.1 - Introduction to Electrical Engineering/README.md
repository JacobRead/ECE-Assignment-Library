# LabVIEW Programming
LabVIEW is a graphical design software created by National Instruments (now the Test and Measurement division of Emerson Electric Company as of Oct 2023).  
  
The following projects in this folder were from my *Introduction to Electrical Engineering* Lab course, now spiced up with my experience working at NI/Emerson from July 2022 to October 2025.

# Software
LabVIEW 2018 is a fully licensed software. While I would love to have the ability to distribute licenses to make my code viewable and runnable to everyone, I do not possess this ability.  
  
To accommodate for this, I have made the code viewable through thorough documentation and runnable through attatched executable versions of the projects that can be run without the required software licenses.

# Hardware
Some labs require both software and hardware to function. The National Instruments data acquisition device I am using for these labs is a National Instruments [MyDAQ](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/engineering-education/portable-student-devices/mydaq/what-is-mydaq.html)
