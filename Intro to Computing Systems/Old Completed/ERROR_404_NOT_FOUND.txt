					ERROR 404- FILE NOT FOUND

It seems that I somehow foolishly deleted the LC3 and its counterparts!


 The LC3 can be redownloaded here:

 All of my code for the semester can be found either on GitHub, or on this PC






***Note: Mcaffee HATES the LC3, so delete it, install the LC3, & then reinstall the security for best results

******Note II: I know the only reason you're here is for the pacman game. Everything else is trash.
