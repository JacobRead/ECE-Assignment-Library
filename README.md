# Welcome to my Back-To-School repository!
Unlike my other public repositories *(coming soon)*, this repo contains multiple projects in multiple languages that all fall under the Back-To-School Umbrella. 

## What is Back-To-School?
This repo is the home for **a redux** of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Homeworks/ Labs/ and Projects I was a part of while an Undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. Using both my degree and my pool of industry experience, I will be re-completing each item with a few key differences. 

## So what's different?

### Testing
This is by far the largest difference. //add more

### Requirements Adjustments
// EZ anti-cheat

## That's cool, but why?
//lol cause I was a shitty student

## Notes on the Content of this Repository

### Content from co-authors, lab partners, Professors, and TAs
A few projects located in this repository may require code from external authors. It is my aim to only publish code in my name that is my own. Hence, the content of some projects such as starter code, non-public headers, or files I have not authored will be removed before uploading if they can not be rewritten or their author's cannot be properly credited.
Each project will contain a README.md documenting the project and it's requirements in order to trivialize any content that may be removed before uploading.

### Academic Dishonesty and the Use of this Repository
// Don't cheat plz
