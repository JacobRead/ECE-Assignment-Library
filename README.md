# Welcome to my Back-To-School repository!
Unlike my other public repositories *(coming soon)*, this repo contains a myriad of projects in multiple languages that all fall under the Back-To-School Umbrella. 

## What is Back-To-School?
This repo is the home for **a redux** of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Homeworks/ Labs/ and Projects I was a part of while an Undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. Using both my degree and my pool of industry experience, I will be re-completing these items with a few key differences. 

## So what's different?

### Testing
As I have long since graduated, I can no longer turn in these assignements to be graded, but I do want to make sure the content I have is accurate, functional, and well written. Hence I will be authoring extensive test suites for each applicable project in order to self-grade. Since my career began in 2022, I have seen firsthand how important software test is to development. Adding test suites to these projects feels like the perfect way to revisit these projects as a professional software developer, using my full range of experience to deliver complete, quality projects.

### Requirements Adjustments
I will also be modifying the requirements of many of these projects both to challenge myself to do something new (on the off chance I have my old answers lying around somewhere), but also to prevent this repo from being used for **EVIL**.
Okay maybe **EVIL** is a bit of a stretch, but what I mean to say is that I'd hate for my personal hobby project to become a source for current students to look online and cheat on their homework. Don't get me wrong, I understand the life of a struggling student, but I stand by my position. To any future students reading this, trust me, you are smart, you got in to your school for a reason, and I believe you can succeed without looking up the answers online.

## That's cool, but why?
All of these projects are relaxing, fun, and interesting to me now, but back when I was still a student, that wasn't always true. Factors such as heavy course workloads, tight project deadlines, frequent Midterm and Final exams, and maybe sometimes being 18-22 and wanting to get out of my dorm on Friday nights, restricted my time and dedication to these projects. Some were completed last minute at 11:59 before the deadline, others may have been submitted with minor failures due to time restrictions. All that to be said is now, post graduation, I can dedicate all the time I want, completing these projects when I want to, and really give them the full attention they deserve to deliver feature complete quality software (and maybe learn a thing or two I missed along the way).

## Notes on the Content of this Repository

### Content from co-authors, lab partners, Professors, and TAs
A few projects located in this repository may require code from external authors. It is my aim to only publish code in my name that is my own. Hence, the content of some projects such as starter code, non-public headers, or files I have not authored will be removed before uploading if they can not be rewritten or their author's cannot be properly credited.
Each project will contain a README.md documenting the project and it's requirements in order to trivialize any content that may be removed before uploading.

### Academic Dishonesty and the Use of this Repository
By uploading my solutions to the problems I was posed as an undergraduate, I am aware of the possibility for future students to find them and pass off as their own.

In order to mitigate this, I have done the following:
- Extracted my own implementation from starter files, and dropped all code with external authors.
- Made requirements adjustments, and excluded distributed requirements documents from this repository.
- Concealed implementation where possible.

By taking these steps, I absolve myself of the resposibility of preventing future students from cheating on their assignments. **If any students do come across my repository, I hope that they can instead benefit from any test suites I have written to validate the answers they have authored on their own.**
